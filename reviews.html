    <div style="text-align: left;">This review is somewhat overdue by about four months.
       Because my husband and I have accumulated so many items over the years, we needed a storage
        unit for leasing. My biggest concern was how secure was the place? I kept hearing things about
         units being broken into and items being stolen from other storage businesses. I can rest assured that such
         is not the case with Alameda Point Storage. They are pretty secure. Access to the storage area
         is via a password on the keypad and only up to 5:00 PM.
</br>
Even though this business is within walking distance from our home and very convenient,
I am not a donkey (or an ass) carrying the load on my back to get here to unload things into the
storage unit. Their monthly leasing fee is reasonable. We took advantage of their offer of leasing
for three months and getting one month free. That offer has expired, but we're still leasing from them.

    <div style="text-align: left;"> "Shelli has been great!
      She found us just the right unit and has been very easy to work with.
      It makes a big difference dealing with someone who enjoys their job.
      Shelli does and it shows. I have a small storage there and they have been nothing but
      nice and professional since the day I moved my things in. They are great folks and
      I recommend you doing business there!!
I give them 5 stars for professionalism, customer service and promptness. Fast easy storage with month to month contracts. They have 3 sizes to choose from, secured doors, and friendly staff. I only stored here for a month, but I'd do it again."
Alameda Point Storage is old, kind of trailer-trashy, and dusty. But it's one of the few places with small storage (5x5), and it's the cheapest place on the island. I just need functional, water-tight, secure, and drive-up-able. Why throw away more money than you need for glamour? This place works just fine.  And, the ladies behind the desk are a hoot (in a good way).

      Shelli does and it shows. We stored our car here for 6 weeks while we travelled--
      it was more affordable than paying for airport parking. All went smoothly--
      staff very friendly and helpful. Lot is secure. The gentleman in the lot even
      said that if our car had failed to start, he would assist with jumper cables.
       Great business! Alameda Point Storage is old, kind of trailer-trashy, and dusty. But it's one of the few places with small storage (5x5), and it's the cheapest place on the island.

    <div style="text-align: left;"> "I really enjoy the security of the facility.
      There is a security camera on every angle and I feel like there is always some employee
       on the compound monitoring whats going on."
